# Concept
I worked with a Marvel API :https://developer.marvel.com
This App is a Marvel search engine, where the user can search any superheros and get the description about them if there is one. 
Once the user typed the the name of the character that they would like information about one the image and name of the hero is displayed after clicking search. the user may click on the image and read about the hero. 

# Approach
I have 3 main pages components- Home page with the search bar and nav bar
about page- marvel app information
herodetails page- the user sees the thumbnail and description

useEffect
useParams
useState
map through character id and herodetails
Try and catch method to fetch the hero data 
async await

# Difficulties and bugs

-Using the marvel API keys to access and the hero information 
-added the ternaty operator that would get the specific data since i was getting an blank every time i clicked on the image about the heros, maybe the optional chaining as metioned
-Had a problem with CORS access trying to get the hero details 
-Had to install md5 and cryto.js for the api to work properly 
-work on getting netlify to work

# Things I want to improve

Complete the information that I intended to add to my hero details page
Styling css
add more interactive features
more features to my nav bar
Pagenation for a footer since there are many heros and to make it more user friendly not having to scroll through every hero
trivia game
